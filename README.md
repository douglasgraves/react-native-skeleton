# React Native Skeleton #
This project provides authentication via Firebase, and starts you off with a simple skeleton project that's all wired up with Redux, Thunk, and a Router (currently using `react-native-router-flux` until the React Native router is ready).

### Set the app up ###
1. Create a Firebase app, enable email/password auth, and paste your env vars into `./src/config.js`
2. `npm install`

### Start the app ###
1. `react-native run-ios`

Add your main page's code to `./src/components/hello.js`, and you should be off and running in no time!
